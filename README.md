</p>

### A repository utilizing a customer segmentation dataset from Kaggle, displaying technique and approaches for customer segmentation implementing clustering algorithms in conjunction with A/B testing in order to draw up business insights and strategies/actionable reccomendations

### Initial Thoughts

<!-- description here -->


## The Plan

<!--* Acquire historical stock price data from the Alpha Vantage API.
* Prepare data
* Explore data in search of drivers of stock closing price
  * Answer the following initial questions
	* Does TSLA stock volume have a correlation with it's daily closing price? 
  	* Is there a significant relationship between the month in which TSLA stock was traded and its closing price?
 	 * Does TSLA daily high stock price have a correlation with open stock price?  
 	 * Is there a significant correlation between the month in which TSLA stock was traded and its closing price?
* Develop a Model to predict Tesla stock closing price
  * Use drivers identified in explore to help build predictive models of different types
  * Feature engineer data if able, no preprocess to include all values.
  * Evaluate models on train and validate data
  * Select the best model based on $RMSE$ and $R^2$
  * Evaluate the best model on test data
* Draw conclusions-->

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--1. Clone this project repository to your local machine.

2. Install project dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your project directory.

3. Obtain an API key from the Alpha Vantage website.

4. Create a config.py file in your project directory with your API key using the following format:

> ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
 
5. Ensure that config.py is added to your .gitignore file to protect your API key.

6. Run the acquire.py script to fetch stock data from the Alpha Vantage API:

> python acquire.py

7. Execute the prepare.py script for data preprocessing and splitting:

> python prepare.py

8. Explore the dataset and answer initial questions using the explore.py script:

> python explore.py

9. Develop machine learning models by running the model.py script:

> python model.py

10. Evaluate the models, select the best-performing one, and draw conclusions based on the results of the model.py script.-->
